# Pymaceuticals

Inside this python file, the analysis of the pymaceuticals csv files will be done.

All in all I was able to create every chart needed except for the boxplot with only the first four treatments. 

There was one mouse ID that was double inputted (g989) which was subsequently removed from the data

After this was done, a line graph was taken for a single mouse' 'tumor volume' and plotted against the times it was recorded. In this instance, the mouse responded well to the treatment and showed the Tumor volume slowly decreasing over time...

After analysis, the two best perforing treatments were Capomulin and Ramicane. The mice in this study not only had a lower average tumor volume but even their outliers seemed to be lower than the rest of the treatments.

One piece of data that may interfere with this analysis is the regression coefficient which is quite strong at 0.84, this means that the average tumor volume is likely to increase along with the average mouse weight. possibly conflicting with the above statement that Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective treatments.

The correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume is 0.84

Enjoy.
